# EncryptionAlgorithms
This is my training in Cryptography with java-8  
The training has the following algorithms:  
1- Caeser Algorithm  
2- Play Fair Algorithm  
3- Fiestel Algorithm  
4- DES Algorithm  
5- RC4 Algorithm  
6- RSA Algorithm  

the app has a simple UI to test the functionality of each algorithm.
